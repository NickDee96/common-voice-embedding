### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/common-voice-embedding.git
   cd common-voice-embedding
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

5. **Run the notebook to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook finetune_embedding.ipynb
   ```

## üìù Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: add support for Yoruba language training
fix: resolve memory leak in embedding generation
docs: update README with deployment instructions
test: add unit tests for data preprocessing
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   - Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks
   - Add new tests for your functionality
   - Test with different languages/scenarios if applicable

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots or examples if relevant

## üåç Language-Specific Contributions

### Adding a New Language

To extend the project to a new language, follow these steps:

1. **Check Common Voice availability**
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset_builder
   
   # Check if language is available
   builder = load_dataset_builder("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_17_0")
   print(builder.info.features)
   ```

2. **Adapt the data loading code**
   ```python
   # Replace "sw" with your language code
   dataset = load_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_17_0", "your_lang_code")
   ```

3. **Consider language-specific preprocessing**
   - Tokenization differences
   - Script-specific handling (Arabic, Chinese, etc.)
   - Cultural context considerations

4. **Evaluate and document results**
   - Compare against baseline metrics
   - Document language-specific insights
   - Share findings with the community

### Language Priority List
We're particularly interested in contributions for:
- **African Languages**: Yoruba, Hausa, Amharic, Igbo, Zulu
- **Asian Languages**: Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Vietnamese
- **European Languages**: Welsh, Irish, Basque, Catalan
- **Indigenous Languages**: Any supported by Common Voice

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/test_data_processing.py
python -m pytest tests/test_model_training.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Add unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for complete workflows
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use representative data samples

## üìä Performance Benchmarks

When contributing performance improvements:

1. **Baseline Comparison**
   - Compare against current best results
   - Use consistent evaluation metrics
   - Test on multiple languages if possible

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Monitor memory consumption
   - Track training time and computational requirements
   - Consider deployment efficiency

3. **Quality Metrics**
   - Maintain or improve IR metrics (NDCG, MRR, Accuracy)
   - Evaluate on diverse query types
   - Test robustness across different domains

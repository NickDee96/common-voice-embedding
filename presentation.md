## Slide 4: The RAG Problem We're Solving
**Two Critical Limitations in Current Systems**

**What is RAG?**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines LLMs with external knowledge retrieval for accurate, contextual responses.

**Problem 1: The "Formality Gap"**
- Users speak colloquially: "How do I fix my car's weird noises?"
- Knowledge bases use formal text: "Automotive diagnostic procedures"
- Poor retrieval due to vocabulary mismatch

**Problem 2: Linguistic Diversity Gaps**
- Traditional corpora miss vernacular expressions
- Underrepresented languages lack sufficient coverage
- Regional variations not captured in formal text

**Impact:** Reduced effectiveness for diverse populations and minority languages

**Visual Elements:**
- RAG architecture diagram
- Examples of formal vs. colloquial query mismatches
- Statistics on language representation gaps

## Slide 5: Mozilla Common Voice - Our Secret Weapon
**The World's Most Diverse Open Speech Dataset**

**Impressive Scale (2024):**
- **30,000+ hours** of recorded speech
- **140+ languages** including underrepresented ones
- **750,000+ contributors** worldwide
- Completely **open source** and public domain

**What Makes It Special:**
- **Natural Speech:** Captures how people actually talk
- **Community-Driven:** Local communities validate their languages
- **Multilingual:** Covers languages ignored by big tech
- **Crowdsourced:** Real people, real voices, real diversity

**Our Innovation:**
Instead of using Common Voice for speech recognition, we leverage its **transcriptions** for text-based RAG enhancement!

**Visual Elements:**
- Global map showing 140+ languages
- Audio waveform transforming into text

## Slide 6: Our Novel Approach - Speech-Derived Text for RAG
**Repurposing Speech Data for Better Text Retrieval**

**The Core Insight:**
Speech transcriptions capture linguistic diversity that traditional text corpora miss - they reflect how people **actually communicate**.

**Three-Step Pipeline:**

**Step 1: Data Preparation**
- Extract transcriptions from Common Voice datasets
- Focus on natural language variations from speech
- Clean and preprocess while preserving colloquialisms

**Step 2: Synthetic Training Data**
- Generate Q&A pairs using GPT-4 from transcriptions
- Create diverse query formulations
- Maintain linguistic authenticity

**Step 3: Embedding Fine-tuning**
- Train BAAI/bge-small-en on speech-derived data
- Bridge formality gap between queries and knowledge
- Create robust retrieval for diverse query types

**Visual Elements:**
- Pipeline diagram: Speech → Transcription → Q&A → Fine-tuning → Enhanced RAG
- Before/after query handling examples

## Slide 7: Why Swahili? Perfect Test Case
**Demonstrating Impact on Underrepresented Languages**

**Swahili as Strategic Choice:**
- **150+ million speakers** across East Africa
- **Well-represented** in Common Voice with active community
- **Underrepresented** in traditional NLP datasets
- **Natural variations** between formal and spoken Swahili

**Technical Advantages:**
- Thousands of validated Common Voice transcriptions
- Multiple speaker demographics and regions
- Rich oral tradition captured in natural speech patterns
- Strong community validation ensuring quality

**Broader Impact:**
Success with Swahili demonstrates scalability to other underrepresented languages across Africa and globally.
